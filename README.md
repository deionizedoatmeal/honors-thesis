# Dark Matter in Population III Stars
## Abstract
After scattering off nucleons, Dark matter (DM) particles may lose enough energy to become gravitationally bound to an astrophysical object.
In order to become captured in this manner, super heavy DM may need to experience a number of successive scattering events.
Once captured within a star, it is possible for DM to continue to upscatter off of nucleons and gain enough energy to escape the potential well in a process known as evaporation.
In the case of captured self-annihilating DM, where DM capture rates are high enough and DM evaporation rates low enough, it then becomes possible for heating from DM annihilations to be a significant source of energy production for Population III (Pop. III) stars. 
By implementing recently developed formalism of multiscatter capture in the stellar evolution code `MESA`, I model how Pop. III stars react to heating from captured DM.
Furthermore I use `MESA` models to calculate DM temperatures and evaporation rates in regions of interest.
Next, I present early results on the influence DM heating has on stellar structure and evolution.
Finally I explore whether or not `MESA` models of DM powered stars may be used to place competitive bounds on important DM properties.
